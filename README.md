# eternalize-bash
Run the eternalize-bash-script, and you will get distributed eternal bash history happiness.

Requirements:
Enviroment that uses .bashrc in a home folder on the format /home/$USER. If you for example run Ubuntu and
use default settings, this will work.

Dropbox, installed in default location. The script will work without it, but it will only give you distributed
bash history between terminals on one machine.

This is experimental stuff, I have tried to make the script so that there is very little chance it will break
anything, but i give no guarantees.
